<br>
<p>
  ****All models were developed using real-life time-series data from credible sources, for educational
  purposes and should not be confused with investment advice.****
  
  
  The algorithm was tested using the historical stock data for <b>General Electric and Apple</b>,
  and was found to have a significant accuracy for prediction.

  It can be seen that the <b>LSTM</b> models was able to predict the fall using the behaviour from past <b>60 Days</b>

  On <b>Dec 14'2020</b>, using the same model, predictions for the next 30 Days were made and, as per predictions
  Reliance NS stock is expected to <b>fall by atleast 8.5% by the next month.</b>
